Implementing features such as auto-complete or go-to-definition for a
programming language is not trivial. Traditionally, this work had to
be repeated for each development tool and it required a mix of
expertise in both the targeted programming language and the
programming language internally used by the development tool of
choice.

A brilliant intuition, the "Language Server Protocol" (LSP), changes
the rules of the game. A real blessing for the Erlang community.

# VSCode

## Setup

The Erlang Language Server is available in VSCode via a [dedicated
extension](https://github.com/erlang-ls/vscode).

To try it out, simply open VSCode and install the extension via the
Marketplace:

    Preferences > Extensions

Look for the `erlang-ls` extension and install it. That's it.

Remember that the Erlang Language Server requires Erlang/OTP 21 or
higher to run, so ensure that OTP 21+ is available in your `PATH`.

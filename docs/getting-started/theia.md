# Theia IDE

## Setup

It is possible to use Erlang LS in Theia IDE by including Erlang/OTP
in your running instance and installing the
[VSCode extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=erlang-ls.erlang-ls).

If you want to give it a try by using GitPod click
[here](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/erlang-ls/erlang_ls).
To use this same setup with your Erlang project (hosted in GitHub or
Gitlab) you can find the GitPod configuration in
[`.gitpod.yml`](https://github.com/erlang-ls/erlang_ls/blob/master/.gitpod.yml).
